# IDS-integrated-with-AI
Note on Live Traffic Capture:
Live intrusion detection depends on network adapter and driver capabilities. On systems where promiscuous packet capture is restricted (e.g., Wi-Fi adapters on Windows), live external attack traffic may not be visible. In such cases, the IDS can be reliably demonstrated using offline PCAP files or loopback-based controlled attacks.
